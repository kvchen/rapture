Why the rapture?
----------------
This project operates on a very simple economic process, creating a tidal flood of returns. In fact, you can even apply this to your own real-life stock portfolio!
Just kidding, this would never actually work in real life. To be fair though, it provides for some very real virtual satisfaction.

What's included?
----------------
This repository contains an API for communicating with stock market games in the [Marketwatch Virtual Stock Exchange](http://www.marketwatch.com/game), as well as an example algorithm for computerized high-frequency trades.

To-do list
----------
* Clean up code
* Reimplement regression-based trader example
* Documentation
* Get actual work done

Getting started
---------------
This python module requires the installation of nonstandard helper modules requests, gevent, grequests, lxml, and bs4. All of these modules can be easily installed via pip.
